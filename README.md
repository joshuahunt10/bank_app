# React App with Redux

## Technical Accomplishments
1. Created a react app using redux and passed global state to multiple components.
2. Able to update the balances in the user accounts that persist until refresh.
3. Pulled in data from an API to display and store on the global state.

## Issues Overcome
1. The actions and reducers supplied as an outline were not structured correctly.  Was able to correct them.
2. The correcting of the reducer created a problem with the transactions later in the project.  This lead to re-writing some of the actions.
